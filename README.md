# Kaggle: USA_Housing
In this notebook we perform some data analysis on USA_Housing dataset provided on Kaggle. This is clearly a regression problem where we are supposed to predict the cantinuous value of the house price. 

Before applying any machine learning technique, first data is analysed and preprossed. In the data there is no missing value which makes it so much easier to preprocess the data. In addition to that there are only 6 independent variable among which is an address feature. The pnly useful information that we can subtract from the address feature is the State. 

The best way to quickly evaluate some dependencies between features is to plot the heatmap that show some correlations between data.
